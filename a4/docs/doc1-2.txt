The Ukrainian navy has accused Russia of firing on and capturing three of its ships near the Kerch Strait, a narrow sea passage close to the Crimean peninsula that separates the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.
Two sailors were injured when the Russian ship fired on Ukraine's vessels, the Ukrainian navy said on Sunday, amid rising tensions between the two countries over a standoff that started earlier in the day.
In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian navy said three of its vessels were forced to stop and captured by the Russian forces.
The spokesperson for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on Twitter the country's top military brass will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday evening.
There was no immediate comment from Russia.
The incident came hours after Moscow placed a large cargo ship beneath the 19km-long Crimean Bridge, which connects the Russian-annexed peninsula with its mainland, blocking all traffic into the strait, the only passage into the Sea of Azov.
Both countries have the right to use the sea, but following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow controls both sides of the strait.
