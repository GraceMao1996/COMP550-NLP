An adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump¡®s election campaign has been ordered to jail following an effort to delay his two-week sentence.
George Papadopoulos must report to jail Monday after he pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI investigators about his links to Russians during Trump¡¯s campaign for the presidency, the Washington Post reported.
Papadopoulos tried to delay his sentence by capitalizing on a constitutional challenge to Robert Mueller¡¯s authority as special counsel.
That case has seen a grand jury witness challenge the legality of Mueller¡¯s appointment, Politico reported.
He argued that, should the challenge succeed, there was potential for his conviction to be thrown out.
U.S. District Court Judge Randy Moss, however, didn¡¯t feel that Papadopoulos¡¯ arguments justified delaying his sentence.
He noted that the Trump advisor didn¡¯t appeal his sentence and that he waived the right to challenge Mueller¡¯s authority himself.
Moss also felt the constitutional challenge to Mueller¡¯s authority was unlikely to succeed.
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communication with a professor from London who informed him about thousands of emails possessed by the Russians that could hurt Clinton¡¯s campaign for the presidency.
The Trump advisor subsequently met Russian nationals and tried to connect them with the Trump campaign.
