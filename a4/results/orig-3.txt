"He has only his own delay to blame." The White House has said that Papadopoulos was a low-level volunteer on the campaign. He noted that the Trump advisor didnt appeal his sentence and that he waived the right to challenge Muellers authority himself. But in an order Sunday, U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss said Papadopoulos had waited too long to contest his sentence after it was handed down in September. That case was brought by a witness refusing to comply with a Mueller grand jury subpoena. Memos written by House Republicans and Democrats and now declassified show that information about Papadopoulos contacts with Russian intermediaries set in motion the FBIs counterintelligence investigation in July 2016 into potential co-ordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.
