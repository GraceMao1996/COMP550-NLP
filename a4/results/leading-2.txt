SHANGHAI  Dolce & Gabbanas co-founders asked for Chinas forgiveness on Friday, trying to salvage a crucial market for the luxury brand after a backlash against its latest advertising campaign. The Italian fashion house canceled a marquee show in Shanghai on Wednesday after celebrities and social media users threatened a boycott over the campaign, which led e-commerce firms to pull Dolce & Gabbana items on Thursday. The furore is a setback for one of Italys best-known fashion brands in China, where rivals from Louis Vuitton of LVMH to Kerings Gucci are vying to expand.
