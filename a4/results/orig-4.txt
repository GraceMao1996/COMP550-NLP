VideoSt. This is all about protecting the brand and the school. Police and the school have said two of the six cases involve sexual assault. St. Michael's also expelled eight students in connection with the allegations. In a statement released Thursday night, the board of directors announced principal Greg Reeves and the schools president, Father Jefferson Thompson, had stepped down. All the charges stem from one incident of alleged sexual assault. Some of the incidents were captured on video and shared online. "This courageous decision allows us to move forward with our goals: understanding how these events could have occurred, regaining the trust of our community and bringing cultural change to our school."
