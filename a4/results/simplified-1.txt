"Their goal is clear," an FSB statement said -- "to create a conflict situation in the region." "What is happening now at the (Kerch) bridge threatens to turn into a very unpleasant story," Kiselyov warned. Russia then blocked off the strait. "Such actions pose a threat to the security of all states in the Black Sea region," the statement said, "and therefore require a clear response from the international community." "Russian coast guard vessels ... carried out openly aggressive actions against Ukrainian navy ships," the Ukrainian navy statement said. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Both countries have the right to use the sea, but following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow controls both sides of the strait.
