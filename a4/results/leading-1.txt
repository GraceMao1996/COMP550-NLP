The Ukrainian navy has accused Russia of firing on and capturing three of its ships near the Kerch Strait, a narrow sea passage close to the Crimean peninsula that separates the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Two sailors were injured when the Russian ship fired on Ukraine's vessels, the Ukrainian navy said on Sunday, amid rising tensions between the two countries over a standoff that started earlier in the day. In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian navy said three of its vessels were forced to stop and captured by the Russian forces.
